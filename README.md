#  Introduction

In order to promote the research and application of semi-supervised learning algorithms, we has developed LAMDA which is a convenient and practical semi-supervised learning toolkit. LAMDA-SSL has complete functions, convenient interfaces and detailed documentations. It integrates statistical machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms into the same framework. It is compatible with the popular machine learning toolkit sklearn and the popular deep learning toolkit pytorch.  It supports Pipeline mechanism and parameter search functions of sklearn and also supports GPU acceleration and distributed training functions of pytorch. At present, LAMDA-SSL contains 30 semi-supervised learning algorithms, including 13 algorithms based on statistical machine learning models and 17 algorithms based on deep learning models. LAMDA-SSL also contains 45 data processing methods used for 4 types of data: table, image, text, graph and 15 model evaluation criterias used for 3 types of task: classification, regression and clustering. LAMDA-SSL includes multiple modules such as data management, data transformation, algorithm application, model evaluation and so on, which facilitates the completion of the end-to-end semi-supervised learning process.

# Quick Start

For example, train a FixMatch classifier for CIFAR10.

Firstly, import and initialize CIFAR10.

```python
from LAMDA_SSL.Dataset.Vision.cifar10 import CIFAR10
dataset=CIFAR10(root='..\Download\cifar-10-python',
                labeled_size=4000,stratified=False,
                shuffle=True,download=True)
labeled_X=dataset.labeled_X
labeled_y=dataset.labeled_y
unlabeled_X=dataset.unlabeled_X
test_X=dataset.test_X
test_y=dataset.test_y
```

Then import and initialize FixMatch.
```python
from LAMDA_SSL.Algorithm.Classifier.Fixmatch import Fixmatch
model=Fixmatch(threshold=0.95,lambda_u=1.0,mu=7,T=0.5,epoch=1,num_it_epoch=2**20,num_it_total=2**20ï¼Œdevice='cuda:0')
```

Next, call the fit() method to complete the training process of the model.
```python
model.fit(X=labeled_X,y=labeled_y,unlabeled_X=unlabeled_X)
```

Finally, call the predict() method to predict the labels of new samples.
```python
pred_y=model.predict(X=test_X)
```
